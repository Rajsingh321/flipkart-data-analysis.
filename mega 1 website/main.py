insights ="""Product-Wise Sales:
Certain products (e.g., Canon ink, Fellowes folders) contribute disproportionately to total salesâ€”top 3 products dominate the chart.

Sub-Category Analysis:
Phones, Chairs, and Storage drive the highest sales within sub-categories. Copiers and Bookcases underperform.

Profitability Gaps:
While some products like Canon ink are both high in sales and profits, others generate sales but contribute little or even negative profit.

Category Performance:
Technology leads in total sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies. However, Office Supplies show more stable profits.

Profit Margin Breakdown:
A large chunk of profit is generated from Technology and Office Supplies, while Furniture has thinner margins overall.

High Loss Products:
Several products show extremely negative profit margins (up to -275%), signaling urgent attention for pricing or promotional review.

Discount Sensitivity:
Profit drastically drops at discounts above 0.3. There's a sweet spot where discounting drives sales without killing margins.

Discount by Category:
Office Supplies benefit the most from discounts, but too much discounting wipes out margins.

Time-Series Trends:
Monthly sales peak around November (likely due to holidays), while yearly trends show steady upward growth from 2015 onward.

Profit Drivers:
Copiers and Accessories are top contributors to profit, while some product lines consistently lose money.
